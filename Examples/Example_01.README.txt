This is an example of loading a simple text file into a Resource.
It's only text.  No delimited records.   There are 4 record formats in the raw data:

    1)  Series/subSeries records
    2)  Indent right, to start a "Record Group".   "Record Group"s can be nested.
    3)  Outdent left, to end a "Record Group"
    4)  And everything else, which becomes an Archival-Object (AO).

The empty Resource is defined in the EAD file "MS_79_Central_Pacific.Empty.ead.xml".  
The Series and SubSeries records are in the EAD.  This is a requirement for this
particular example.

The starting data is "Central_Pacific.unedited.txt".  This was exported from a Word doc as txt.

The manually edited version of the file is "Central_Pacific.edited.txt".  

The manual edits were:
    1)  Making sure the Series/SubSeries record text matches what was actually in the EAD.
    2)  Added ">:" and "<:" records to delineate the "Record Groups".  
    3)  Fixed up some of the data.
    
The formatter is programmed to:
    1)  Find the Series/subSeries records and mark them as "new_parent" records.  The add_objects program
        will find the matching AO in the Resource and attach all the following records to it.
    2)  Find the ">:" and "<:" records and output an indent right or left record along with a "recordgrp" record
        with the text.
    3)  Parse the "everything else" records, looking for specific data inside brackets [].  This data is
        passed to the add_objects program which eventually adds AO's, "notes", and "top-containers".
        
How to run...

    Import the "MS_79_Central_Pacific.Empty.ead.xml" file into ArchivesSpace.

run the "central_pacific" formatter program to convert the "Central_Pacific.edited.txt" file into a file for the add_objects program, as follows:

    $ cat Central_Pacific.edited.txt | ruby -w -S formatter.txt.to.add_objects.central_pacific.rb > central_pacific.as_input.txt

The "central_pacific.as_input.txt" file has 5 record formats:

    1)  {"__RECORD__":{"level":"__NEW_PARENT__","title":"Series 1: Financial Records"}}
        The new_parent record is used to find an AO with the matching "title".  All following
        records are attached to the found record.  It doesn't have to any specific type of AO record.
        
    2)  {"__RECORD__":{"level":"recordgrp","title":"Abstract of earnings and operating expenses"}}
    3)  {"__INDENT__":["__RIGHT__","Abstract of earnings and operating expenses"]}
        These two records are the start of a new "Record Group".   There's the "recordgrp" record itself, which creates the AO record, then
        the "indent right" record. They'll always be in this order.  The "indent" record tells the add_objects program
        to attach following records to the previous "recordgrp" record.  (The text in the "indent record"
        is just for debug purposes.)
        
    4)  {"__RECORD__":{"level":"file","notes":[{"jsonmodel_type":"note_singlepart","ingest_problem":","type":"physloc","publish":true,"content":["Shelf I2.200.C7"],"label":"Statewide Museum Collections Center"}],"__CONTAINER__":{"__TC_TYPE__":"Box","__TC_INDICATOR__":"208","__SC_TYPE__":"object","__SC_INDICATOR__":"653"},"title":"Abstracts of cash disbursements, Sacramento Division, [Volume] Apr. - May 1912 "}}
        This is a "normal" data record used to create a AO.  This record has a "notes" array, as well as a "__CONTAINER__" hash that will be used to find
        the matching "top container", or create it, and attach the AO to it (along with any subcontainer data).
        
    5)  {"__INDENT__":["__LEFT__","<:"]}
        This is the "end indent" records.   This "pops" the "recordgrp" stack.


The "central_pacific.as_input.txt" is then used as input to the add_objects program, which is run as follows:

    $ ruby -w -S archivesspace.add_objects.rb --res-num 126 [--update] central_pacific.as_input.txt

                                              --res-num 126 is the resource number (126 in the example).

The output will looks something like:

archivesspace.add_objects.rb:223:in '<main>': initial_parent_AO_uri = /repositories/2/resources/126         <<<<  The default parent of all records, recourse 126.
