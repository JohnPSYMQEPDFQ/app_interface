<p>¶ The Central Pacific Collection contains eight series of documents and files from various sectors of the Central Pacific Railroad Company. The earliest documents in this collection are dated 1861, while the latest go to 1959. Thus this collection represents nearly one-hundred years of railroad history. ¶</p><p>¶ The largest series in this collection are the financial records which span the length of the entire series (1861-1959). Notable financial records include the purchase of locomotives, rolling stock, equiptment, and building materials by C. P. Huntington for the company, as well as handwritten entries into the Huntington Cash Book giving intricate details of the purchases arranged in chronological order. There are two additional cash books that likewise contain handwritten entries, as well as newspaper and political clippings pertaining to events in Sacramento circa 1870. Finally, there is a collection of invoices, notes, and bills from vendors to the Central Pacific company from the 1860s and 1880s. ¶</p><p>¶ The next four series contain various documents and forms from the Land, Engineering, Equiptment, and Personnel sections of the Central Pacific. The Engineering series contains vouchers, invoices, inventory, and payroll ledgers for the department that detail what was purchased between 1862 and 1863, the list of employees and what they made during that same period, and an inventory of the shops in 1861 and 1873. The Personnel series consists entirely of payroll sheets from the Central Pacific Contruction Department (responsible for the actual building of the railroad), and includes handwritten details from Charles Crocker about the workers, their position, rate of pay, and total pay These records span from 1864 to 1866. Included in the writings are details on the Chinese gangs that worked seperately from the rest of the general labor force, and a single volume on unpaid wages from 1882-1885. The Eqiptment secion contains several boxes of specificaltions and schematics of various cars built and used by the Central Pacific between 1868 and 1929. Included are the schematics for passenger cars (1st class and coach), freight cars, and pieces of equiptment used to maintain them. ¶</p><p>¶ The Land Depatment series contains eight volumes of property books that detail all of the lands owned by the Central Pacific in Oregon, California, Nevada, and Utah between 1910 and 1949. There is additionally a three volume set of day books containing records of deeds, contracts, and cancellations from 1870 to 1883. Finally there is one volume containing station schematics from circa 1880. ¶</p><p>¶ The final three sections concern tariff forms, miscellaneous documents, and letters from the Office of the Secretary. The Tariff section contains samples of tariff forms for passenger and freight cars from the Central Pacific, as well as the Union Pacific railroad companies from 1875 to 1878. The miscellaneous series contains a litany of forms, including lists of tools on each locomotive, meteorlogical observation charts, and wage forms for personnel. The dates of the misc. section vary from the 1870s, through the early 1900s. The section concerning the Offic of the Secretary contains fifteen volumes that deal with bond records, mortgage rates, and coupons from 1899 to 1917. ¶</p>  </scopecontent>

The payrolls are handwritten on printed forms and were issued by the railroad for "C[harles] Crocker, Contractor."

The collection includes some payroll sheets for Chinese labor gangs, as well as payroll information for James Strobridge and other construction officials. ¶</p><p>¶ The payrolls are numbered consecutively for the period 1864-1865. A new consecutive numbering system seems to have been instituted in 1866, starting again with the number one. The payrolls are arranged by year and then by number. The CSRM Library does not have a complete set; there are missing numbers within each year. An inventory to the payroll vouchers, prepared when they were in the possession of Southern Pacific, has been placed in each box. While the inventory is not complete, it does identify specific Camps, Camp officials, as well as the vouchers which record Chinese labor.
